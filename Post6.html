                    <p>With so many varieties of tomatoes to choose from, you might be left wondering “what’s the difference?”. Below I discuss the most common varieties grown today and what traits makes them so loved</p><br>
                        <h4>Grape Tomatoes.</h4><p>Crisp and crunchy, grape tomatoes come in a variety of colors that range from sweet to tangy. Thanks to their thicker skin, grape tomatoes hold their meaty texture when cooked, making them a great addition to a main dinner dish—whether you’re roasting them in the oven, tossing them into your pasta, or adding a colorful side to your steak, chicken, or fish. Whether you prefer a red grape’s candy-like sweetness or the tangy kick of a yellow grape, these tomatoes are also great for snacking on raw.

                        <h4>Red Beefsteak Tomatoes.</h4><p>The king of tomatoes, THE salsa tomato. Red Beefsteak tomatoes are large and meaty with lots of juice, making them ideal to use as a base for fresh sauces and dips. Red Beefsteak’s mild flavor makes them the perfect complement to any dish, without being too overpowering. They make a great addition to your classic hamburger or BLT, and can even hold their own as a patty substitute!

                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>Born in the UK and now living Toronto, Canada. I've lived a varied life with experiences to last a lifetime. These days I work in I.T. for an architecture firm. In the evening and on the weekends, I split time between hanging out with the family, learning something new and experimenting with my new hobby of growing tomatoes in the city. Cooking, coding, camping and plenty in between. Variety is the spice of life!!</p>

                    <h4>Determinate versus Indeterminate tomato type</h4>
                    <img src="Determinate-Indeterminate-tomato-plants.png">
                    <p>Determinate tomato plants are bushy and grow to aboust 3 to 5 feet and top off at that height. Indeterminate tomato plants grow as vines, don’t top off, and continuously produce tomatoes throughout the season until frost or disease kills the plants.</p>

                    <h4>Roma Tomatoes</h4>
                    <p>The quintessential Italian plum tomato, Roma tomatoes are full of flavor with a tangy, garden-fresh tomato taste. This tomato is ideal for making a delicious stew, sauce, or tomato paste. For an even more intense flavor, try roasting your Roma in the oven and using it to create a tomato pesto or bruschetta topping that has a bit of a kick. With so many ways to use and a delicious flavor.</p>

                    <h4>Cherry Tomatoes</h4>
                    <p>A favorite of tomato lovers everywhere, cherry tomatoes are one the most versatile tomatoes around. With red, orange, yellow, and purple varieties, these tomatoes are a cooking mainstay, adding a burst of color and flavor to any meal. Sweet and tangy, cherry tomatoes can be cooked, grilled, sauced, and dried—and if you really can’t get enough—even eaten as a raw snack.</p>

                    <h4>Heirloom Tomatoes</h4>
                    <p>Get back to your culinary roots with heirloom tomatoes that have been passed down for generations. With a wide range of sizes and vibrant colors, heirlooms are also rich in flavor. These tomatoes are a perfect addition to sandwiches and salads, make a delicious grilled or roasted side dish, and taste great raw with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of salt.</p>
